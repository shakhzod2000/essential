# Essential Words 4000

This is my first web development project!

This website was developed to help you learn German first, and later other languages, through a fun quiz. The words come from the English book "Essential 4000."

When I was learning English, I realized that vocabulary is the most important aspect of language learning. The book "Essential 4000" was my favorite book that helped me improve my vocabulary and overall English level. Unfortunately, I couldnâ€™t find a similar book like "Essential 4000" when learning German, so I decided to create a website where people can learn all the words from "Essential 4000."

Hopefully, this will be very useful.
