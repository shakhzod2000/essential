# About Essential-Words.com

This is my first web development project!

This website is designed to make language learning fun and effective through interactive quizzes. Initially, the site focused on learning German, later English was added and the platform will eventually expand to support other languages. The words come from the English book "Essential 4000."

When I was learning English, I realized that vocabulary is the most important aspect of language learning. The book "Essential 4000" was my favorite book that helped me improve my vocabulary and overall English level. Unfortunately, I couldnâ€™t find a similar book like "Essential 4000" when learning German, so I decided to create a website where people can learn all the words from "Essential 4000."

The platform aims to provide language learners with a structured and engaging way to master essential words, leveraging the methodology and spirit of the "Essential 4000 Words" book.

I hope this website will help you achieve your language-learning goals, just as the original book helped me.
